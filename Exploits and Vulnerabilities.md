# CVE-2025-29927 - Next.js

## Description.
Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Prior to 14.2.25 and 15.2.3, it is possible to bypass authorization checks within a Next.js application, if the authorization check occurs in middleware. If patching to a safe version is infeasible, it is recommend that you prevent external user requests which contain the x-middleware-subrequest header from reaching your Next.js application. This vulnerability is fixed in 14.2.25 and 15.2.3.



Add header to get-request (right under "Host" in BurpSuite):
>	x-middleware-subrequest: middleware


## Patches:
- Next.js 15.x should upgrade to 15.2.3
- Next.js 14.x should upgrade to 14.2.25
- Next.js 13.x should upgrade to 13.5.9
- Next.js 12.x should upgrade to 12.3.5
